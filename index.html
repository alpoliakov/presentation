					<h3>Full-Bleed Layout Using CSS Grid</h3>
					<p>an elegant solution to a tricky modern layout</p>
				</section>
				<section data-transition="zoom">
					<section>
						<p>Back in the day, there was a gold-standard website layout that everyone strived to create,
							but that was notoriously difficult to get right: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_grail_(web_design)" target="_blank"> <strong>Holy Grail layout</strong></a>.
						</p>
					</section>

						<p>It doesn't seem like it would be so tricky, right? But this was an era before flexbox existed;
							our tools for the job were tables and floats, and neither were really up to this task. It was technically possible,
							but some shenanigans were required.
						</p>
						<p>Once flexbox achieved mainstream browser support, this layout went from "holy grail" to "fountain drink";
							it was everywhere, because it offered a great user experience, and was within reach for all developers.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							As the web has evolved, I've discovered a new aspirational layout. It offers a fantastic user experience,
							especially for long-form text content like news articles or documentation. But, like its predecessor,
							it's been deceptively hard to achieve; most implementations require obscure hacks or counterintuitive tricks.
						</p>
						<p>
							I recently discovered an elegant solution to this problem using CSS Grid. In this post, we'll learn how it works!

						<h3>The problem</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Have you ever tried to read Wikipedia on a very large screen? It looks like this:</p>
						<img src="https://i.ibb.co/vvfg6BX/two.png" alt="two" border="0">
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							Those paragraphs are so wide! Wikipedia doesn't constrain the container width at all. This leads to lines
							that are hundreds of characters in length.
						</p>
						<p>
							It's hard for our eyes to wrap around when we reach the and of a line. If you're like me, you wind up
							using your mouse to assist:
						</p>
						<video data-autoplay src="./src/video/wikipedia-assist.mp4"></video>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>The standard solution to this problem is to create a single fixed-width column in the center of the page.
							You've seen this layout everywhere: online magazines, documentation, news sites, and blogs. You're looking
							at it right now, on this site!
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="https://i.ibb.co/2h469M9/three.png" alt="three" border="0">
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							There's a complicating factor, however—not all content should be constrained. We should allow images,
							videos, and custom widgets to break free and fill the available width:
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<div class="full__bleed">
							<span class="post__image_wrapper">
								<img src="https://i.ibb.co/pfk68jW/meerkat.jpg" class="post__image_img" alt="meerkat" border="0">
							</span>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							The common term for this kind of thing is “full-bleed”. It's a term borrowed from the publishing world;
							when something is printed full-bleed, it extends to the very edge of the paper.
						</p>
						<p>
							This new requirement makes the problem considerably more tricky. It's relatively easy to constrain all
							children, but CSS doesn't really have a mechanism to selectively constrain some children.

						<h3>The solution</h3>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-easing="cubic-bezier(0.770, 0.000, 0.175, 1.000)">
						<p>
							Let's start at the end, with our solution:
						</p>
						<p data-id="code-title">CSS</p>
						<pre data-id="code-animation">
							<code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
								.wrapper {
								  display: grid;
								  grid-template-columns:
								    1fr
								    min(65ch, 100%)
								    1fr;
								}
								.wrapper > * {
								  grid-column: 2;
								}
								.full-bleed {
								  width: 100%;
								  grid-column: 1 / 4;
								}
							</code>
						</pre>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-easing="cubic-bezier(0.770, 0.000, 0.175, 1.000)">
						<p>
							These styles are assigned to markup in this shape:
						</p>
						<p data-id="code-title">HTML</p>
						<pre data-id="code-animation">
							<code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
								<script type="text/template">
									<main class="wrapper">
										<h1>Some Heading</h1>
										<p>Some content and stuff</p>
										<img class="full-bleed" alt="cute meerkat" src="/meerkat.jpg" />
									</main>
								</script>
							</code>
						</pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>There's a lot to unpack here, so let's go through it step by step.</p>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-easing="cubic-bezier(0.770, 0.000, 0.175, 1.000)">
						<h6>The grid</h6>
						<p data-id="code-title">CSS</p>
						<pre data-id="code-animation">
							<code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
								.wrapper {
								  display: grid;
								  grid-template-columns:
								    1fr
								    min(65ch, 100%)
								    1fr;
								}
							</code>
						</pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							<strong class="text__color_tomato">grid-template-columns</strong>  is a property that lets us define the
							shape of our grid. By providing 3 discrete values, we're indicating that we want 3 columns.
						</p>
						<p>
							The values define the width of each column. The first column is 1fr, same as the last column. The fr unit
							is a flexible unit that fills available space. It's similar in principle to flex-grow; it's a ratio of
							how much of the free space the column should consume.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							Our center column is a fixed width. We use the min helper to pick whichever value winds up being smaller.
							On large screens, it will take up 65ch width. On smaller screens, where there isn't enough horizontal space
							for 65 characters, it is clamped to 100% of the available container width.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Here's what this looks like, in practice:</p>
						<img src="https://i.ibb.co/nPxjrpf/four.png" alt="four" border="0">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h6>Assigned children column</h6>
						<p>We've defined a 3-column grid, and now it's time to assign children to it.</p>
						<p data-id="code-title">CSS</p>
						<pre data-id="code-animation">
							<code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
								.wrapper > * {
								  grid-column: 2;
								}
							</code>
						</pre>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-easing="cubic-bezier(0.770, 0.000, 0.175, 1.000)">
						<p>In CSS Grid, columns are 1-indexed, so 2 is a reference to the middle column.</p>
						<p>We're saying that every child should be assigned to that second middle column. Each new child will
							create a new row, like so:
						</p>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-easing="cubic-bezier(0.770, 0.000, 0.175, 1.000)">
						<img src="https://i.ibb.co/ZTnkCk0/five.png" alt="five" border="0">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h6>Full bleed children</h6>
						<p>We've seen how our grid can constrain elements of all types, but what about when we want a child to break
							free and fill the available width?
						</p>
						<p>That's where this fella comes in:</p>
						<p data-id="code-title">CSS</p>
						<pre data-id="code-animation">
							<code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
								.full-bleed {
								  width: 100%;
								  grid-column: 1 / 4;
								}
							</code>
						</pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							This special .full-bleed class allows a specific child to bust out of that column, and span all 3 columns.
							1 / 4 is a start/end syntax; we're saying the element should start on Column 1 (inclusive) and span all
							the way to Column 4 (exclusive).
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img class="big__img" src="https://i.ibb.co/B4zMbSZ/six.png" alt="six" border="0">
						<p>
							The trick is that each child becomes its own grid row, and each child can fill as much of that row as it
							wants. Most elements will only ever occupy that center column, but some will instead span all 3.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section data-transition="zoom">
					<section>
						<h3>Padding</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							On smaller screen-sizes, we want to add a bit of padding, so that our text isn't right at the edge of the
							display.
						</p>
						<p>
							We can accomplish this in a number of ways, including straight-up using padding! But since this is an
							article about CSS Grid, let's check out the grid-based solution:
						</p>
						<p data-id="code-title">CSS</p>
						<pre data-id="code-animation">
							<code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
								.wrapper {
								  display: grid;
								  grid-template-columns: 1fr min(60ch, calc(100% - 64px)) 1fr;
								  grid-column-gap: 32px;
								}
							</code>
						</pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							<strong class="text__color_tomato">grid-column-gap</strong> is a nifty property which lets us add gutters
							between columns. In this case, I've hardcoded a value of 32px.
						</p>
						<p>
							This introduces a problem, though; because of this extra space, we'll wind up with the dreaded horizontal
							scrollbar on mobile 😡
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							The reason is that gaps are outside columns. We're telling our column to consume 100% of the available
							width, and we're saying that the column should have 32px of space on each side of it. If our device has a
							500px-wide screen, we'll wind up rendering 564px worth of stuff (500px column + 32px per side).
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							We can solve this problem with an absolutely magical CSS property, <strong class="text__color_tomato">calc</strong>.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							<strong class="text__color_tomato">calc</strong> lets us mix units of different types. In this case, what
							we want is to clamp our center column to be 64px shorter than the full width. We can derive this value
							with <strong class="text__color_tomato">calc(100% - 64px)</strong>. This will become our new minimum width for mobile devices.
						</p>

						<h3>Conclusion</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							CSS Grid is super powerful, and now that it's achieved <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-grid" target="_blank">wide browser support</a>,
							it can solve so many of our problems!
						</p>
						<p>Some readers have suggested that the same effect could be accomplished with flexbox, or without the use
							of a wrapper at all. Unfortunately, there are some trade-offs that make those alternatives unworkable.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							The historical solution to this problem uses negative margins. It works perfectly well, but it feels a
							bit hacky to me. You can read more about that solution
							on <a href="https://css-tricks.com/full-width-containers-limited-width-parents/" target="_blank">CSS Tricks</a>.
